This software is a ported version of TeX Live 2012 (http://tug.org/texlive/) and was built
with only minor modifications (detailed below). 

Some of the standard packages (notably XeTeX) were disabled for the build. The system has
been tested primarily with pdfTeX, but some other *TeX systems should work. If you need
a system that isn't provided by default, you may need to adjust the build settings and 
some source files.

###
Build instructions for TeX Live on the PlayBook (in 3 easy steps!).
###

0: 		Obtain a copy of the TeX Live source and the TeX Live texmf directories
			(e.g. from ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive/2012/
				  texlive-20120701-texmf.tar.xz  -> TeX Live directory
				  texlive-20120701-source.tar.xz -> Source directory)
0.5:	Copy the texmf-config, texmf-var, and texmf-local directories from a suitable TeX
			Live distribution such as the one on your normal machine to the TeX Live
			directory. Alternatively, you could generate the configuration files yourself.
1:		Apply the pbmods.patch file to the TeX Live source directory
			(e.g. cd ./texlive-20120701-source; patch -p1 < ../pbmods.patch)
1.5:	Modify the ./playbook_build.sh script and point it to your BlackBerry native SDK
			(and probably modify the build type as well)
2: 		Run the ./playbook_build.sh script.
3: 		Copy ./$SRC_DIR/inst/bin (and ./$SRC_DIR/inst/lib if necessary) to the TeX Live
			directory

Once built, you can:

4: 		Zip your distribution (and optionally move it to ./distros-zipped)
5: 		Extract and install your zipped distribution using bbTeX after copying it to your
			PlayBook (or move it to ../../bbTeX/texlive and build bbTeX from source)

NOTE:
./pbmods.patch indicates the changes that were necessary for the texlive-20120701 source
to be built for the PlayBook. More (or fewer) changes may be necessary for future 
distributions.
